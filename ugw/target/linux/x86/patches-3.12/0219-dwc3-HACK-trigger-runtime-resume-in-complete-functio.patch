Subject: [PATCH 219/441] dwc3: HACK: trigger runtime resume in complete
 function

During the process from S3 -> S0 resume (dwc3 is in runtime
suspended state),  if VBUS event comes before resume early
function, then it will invoke runtime get when runtime pm is
still disabled for S3, and runtime enable function invoked
in device resume early function only change the flags, will
not trigger anything else, so there is no chance to get runtime
state back to active even usage count is not zero.
The problem here is after attached to PC host, dwc3 pci device
still in D3 state as no active kid, device mode is not working.
One workaround method is to trigger it manually in complete
function, but it should only be a HACK.
