Subject: [PATCH 375/441] Title: Fix the ioremap error Issue: HSD 243893
 IssueType: Defect Symptom: ioremap error message during the boot. RootCause:
 The ioremap is hardcoded as non-cached. However, the dmi_base(0x3dfde000) is
 supposed to be cached memory. PAT memtype list: write-back @
 0x3df80000-0x3e020000 That is why we get this error message. ioremap error
 for 0x3dfde000-0x3dfdf000, requested 0x10 (_PAGE_CACHE_UC_MINUS), got 0x0
 (_PAGE_CACHE_WB) Resolution: Use ioremap_cache for dmi table Approvers:
 CCID-243893
